<p>My research interests orbit understanding urban change through the lens of urban political economy. I am interested in how to create better policies and strategies to address persistent inequities in resources and power.

<p>To understand urban change, I apply both qualitative and quantitative research methods, including contemproary data science techniques.

<p>I earned my PhD in Geography at the University of Minnesota.I studied long-wave cycles of technological change and capitalist restructuring. I argue power and politics are crucial to this process. My research interrogates Amazon as a cipher to understand capitalist restructuring in the 1990s, the rise of the New Economy, shifts in urban class composition, and the rise of new political alliances in our current era of political instability.

<p>I live in St Paul, Minnesota with my partner and daughter. I enjoy cooking (and eating), being outdoors, sports ball playing, and hanging with friends and family.
